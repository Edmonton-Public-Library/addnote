Project Notes
-------------
This script was developed to cope with reciprocal borrowers. We have thousands, and we 
want to add a note on all of their accounts to ask staff to change their accounts to 
EPL-METRO. What ever your requirement, if you need to put a note on a lot of accounts
this is the script for you. 

It does not remove notes, merely adds a new one.

Instructions for Running:
cat user_barcodes.lst | addnote.pl -m"Message for note field." -U
